    question: "What types of vulnerabilities are in scope?",
    answer:
      "Our vulnerability disclosure program covers security issues in our own products and services, including our website, web applications, APIs, and mobile applications. In-scope vulnerabilities include but are not limited to: SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), authentication flaws, authorization bypasses, server-side request forgery (SSRF), and business logic vulnerabilities that could impact the security of our systems or user data.",
  },
  {
    question: "How should I report a security vulnerability?",
    answer:
      "Please report security vulnerabilities via email to security@vepdec.com. We encourage the use of encryption - our PGP key is available on our website. Your report should include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any supporting materials like screenshots or proof-of-concept code. Please allow us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before any public disclosure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer a bug bounty program?",
    answer:
      "While we don't currently offer a formal bug bounty program with monetary rewards, we do recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us. With your permission, we'll acknowledge your contribution in our security hall of fame. We're also exploring the possibility of implementing a structured bug bounty program in the future.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after I submit a vulnerability report?",
    answer:
      "After submitting a report, you'll receive an acknowledgment within 3 business days. Our security team will investigate and validate the issue, then work on developing and testing a fix. We'll keep you updated on our progress and notify you when the vulnerability has been resolved. We aim to address critical vulnerabilities within 30 days, though the timeline may vary depending on complexity.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I NOT do when testing for vulnerabilities?",
    answer:
      "When testing for vulnerabilities, please refrain from: accessing, modifying, or deleting other users' data; executing denial of service attacks; physical attacks against our offices or data centers; social engineering of our employees; using automated vulnerability scanners that may impact system performance; and testing third-party applications or services we use but don't control. Always conduct testing in a way that minimizes potential harm.",
